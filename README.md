## Overview
Welcome to mpox-seek! Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through [mpox-seek's documentation](https://openomics.github.io/mpox-seek/).

The **`./mpox-seek`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

 * [<code>mpox-seek <b>run</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/mpox-seek/usage/run/): Run the mpox-seek pipeline with your input files.
 * [<code>mpox-seek <b>unlock</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/mpox-seek/usage/unlock/): Unlocks a previous runs output directory.
 * [<code>mpox-seek <b>install</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/mpox-seek/usage/install/): Download reference files locally.
 * [<code>mpox-seek <b>cache</b></code>](https://openomics.github.io/mpox-seek/usage/cache/): Cache software containers locally.

**mpox-seek** is a streamlined viral metagenomics pipeline to align, collapse, and visualize targeted or whole-genome monekypox samples. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from [Nanopore sequencing technologies](https://nanoporetech.com/). As input, it accepts a set of FastQ files and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](https://openomics.github.io/mpox-seek/usage/run/) section of each available sub command.

## Dependencies
**Requires:** `snakemake<8.0`  `conda/mamba` `singularity>=3.5 (optional)`  

[Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) must be installed on the target system. Snakemake is a workflow manager that orchestrates each step of the pipeline. The second dependency, i.e [singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/all-releases) OR [conda/mamba](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge), handles the dowloading/installation of any remaining software dependencies. By default, the pipeline will utilize singularity to guarantee the highest level of reproducibility; however, the `--use-conda` option of the [run](https://openomics.github.io/mpox-seek/usage/run/) sub command can be provided to  use conda/mamba instead of singularity. If possible, we recommend using singularity over conda for reproducibility; however, it is worth noting that singularity and conda produce identical results for this pipeline. If you plan on running this pipeline on a laptop or desktop computer, we recommend using conda/mamba over singularity.

If you are running the pipeline on Windows, please use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Singularity can be installed on WSL following these [instructions](https://www.blopig.com/blog/2021/09/using-singularity-on-windows-with-wsl2/).
